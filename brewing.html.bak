<h3 id="boiling">Boiling</h3>

<p>boiling ,or decoction,was the main method used in brewing tea until the 1930s and is still used in some Nordic and  Middle Eastern contries.The aromatic oils in tea are released at 96`c(205`F),which is just below boiling,while the bitter acids are released when the water has reached boiling point.</p>

<p>The simplest method is to Boil water.Different types of tea require different water temperature to brew. Check the tea packaging to see the recommended water temperature.Warm up teapot.This step is a detail that takes your tea to the next level and almost no one does it. But they should.</p>
 <p>Take some of the boiled water and fill half the teapot and give it a few swirls then throw out the water. We’re warming the teapot so that when the hot water for tea goes in, the water temperature won’t drop too much.
Put tea into teapot and add hot water.Cover teapot and steep tea.Set the timer on your phone to steep it to the correct amount of time. The steep time is different for each kind of tea so check the tea package to see what is recommended. Usually it’s no more than 5 minutes.Strain tea solids and pour hot tea into tea cups.
If you want to have another cup, pour more hot water into the teapot (using the same tea leaves) and set the timer again. For the second steep, add 1-2 more minutes</p>

<h3 id="steeping">Steeping</h3>

<p>All TeaSource tea comes with suggested steeping suggestions on the back of the bag. Remember to refer to these instructions when making your tea. Preparing tea properly can be easy and delicious if you follow these basic guidelines, but feel free to experiment and adjust to fit your personal tastes.</p>

 <p>Steeping a tea bag essentially means soaking it. If you drink tea regularly, you probably steep it daily. Steeping a tea bag is the process of extracting the bioactive compounds and flavor from tea solids. It is the perfect example of osmosis and diffusion. The tea particles that produce flavanols like caffeine and color move from a high-concentrated area to a lower concentration in the water. Water, being ideal at receiving molecules, works to create the best scent and taste of the tea, creating a perfect cup of tea for you The common loose-leaf tea should not be steeped for more than 5 minutes. Depending on the variety, steeping longer than 5 minutes won’t hurt your cup of tea but it can change the flavor of the tea, increase the amount of potential caffeine and may cause the tea to have a more bitter taste.</p>

<h3 id="filtration">Filtration methods</h3>

<p>Filtration is the process of removing solid particles from liquid or gaseous fluids by passing the fluid through a filter media while keeping the solid particles behind.The intended product might be either the fluid that has been cleared or the fluid that has had its solid particles removed.</p>
<p>Tea leaves can be easily separated from tea by filtration.A common example would be when making a cup of tea. A teabag is made of a material that allows water to pass through but does not let the solid tea leaves escape. The solid tea leaves are filtered out using the bag but the tea flavours which dissolve in the hot water are able to pass through.</p>
